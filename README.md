# Pokedex
This simple API is a Pokedex.

Two url sites are included in App.js. 
One is for the informations from each pokemon and other from the images.  

In Index.html, we have a link from the JavaScript code and CSS code.

To run all of then, we need to download the extension called "Live Server".
Click with the right way of the mouse above the html code, and click "Open with Live Server".
